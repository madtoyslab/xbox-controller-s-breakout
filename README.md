Xbox Controller S breakout - allows to use pretty much anything to control an original Xbox if wired to a gamepad

[ /!\ REPO BEING CURRENTLY UPDATED ]
- the .ino file present in the sketch directory is the current debug sketch
- the code handling the "Ã¼berjoys" is setup for their v0.1a breakout board ( that is, with 4 transistors, not 5 ) 
- the lib currently only provides advanced handling for the status LED (blinking patterns  ), but not anything else

"I wanna play Mario64 emulated on an original Xbox using the Emotiv Epoc headset as controller" ? => wip ;P
